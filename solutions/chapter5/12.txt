5.12 Answer each of the following questions.
a) What is the difference between passing arguments by arguments and passing arguments
by reference?
Answer: Passing arguments by value means that a copy of the argument's value is passed to the 
        function which means that any modifications made to the value of the argument will not
        affect the original value of the variable outside the function.

        Passing arguments by reference means that the memory address of the argument is passed to 
        the function which allows the function to directly modify the value of the argument, and any
        changes made to the argument in the function will affect the original value of the argument
        outside the function

b) What values does the rand function generate?
Answer: The rand() function generates a random integer value between 0 and the constant RAND_MAX,
        which is typically defined as 32767 in . The actual range
        of values that can be generated by rand() depends on the specific implementation of the 
        function and the size of the integer data type used on the system where the program is running.

c) How do you randomize a program? How do you scale or shift the values produced by
 the rand function?
Answer: In order to generate random values within a specific range, we can use the modulo operator % 
        to constrain the range of values generated by rand(). 

d) What is a recursive function? What is a base case?
Answer: This is a function that calls itself either directly or indirectly.
        A recursive function typically has two components: one that provides a means for the
        recursion to terminate by testing for a BASE CASE, and one that expresses the
        problem as a recursive call for a slightly simpler problem than the original call.
        The BASE CASE is therefore the simplest form of the recursive function.
