6.3 Follow the instructions below regarding an array called fractions.
a) Define a symbolic constant SIZE to be replaced with the replacement text 10.

b) Define an array with SIZE elements of type double and initialize the elements to 0. 
DOUBLE fractions[SIZE] = {0.0};
c) Refer to array element 4.
fractions[3];
d) Assign the value 1.667 to array element nine.
fractions[8] = 1.667;
e) Assign the value 3.333 to the seventh element of the array.
fractions[6] = 3.333;

point, and show the output that’s displayed on the screen.
printf("%.2f %.2f", fractions[5], fractions[8]);
g) Print all the elements of the array, using a for iteration statement. Assume the integer
variable x has been defined as a control variable for the loop. Show the output.

    printf("fractions[%u] = %f\n", x, fractions[x]);
}
output:
6.4 Write statements to accomplish the following: 
a) Define table to be an integer array and to have 3 rows and 3 columns. Assume the symbolic constant SIZE has been defined to be 3.
code: int myArray[SIZE][SIZE];
b) How many elements does the array table contain? Print the total number of elements.
ans: nine
code: printf("%d", SIZE * SIZE);
c) Use a for iteration statement to initialize each element of table to the sum of its indices.
code: for(size_t x = 0; x < SIZE; ++x){
    for(size_t y = 0; y < SIZE; ++y){
        myArray[x][y] = x + y;
    }
    printf("\n");
}
Assume the integer variables x and y are defined as control variables.
d) Print the values of each element of array table. Assume the array was initialized with
the definition: 
int table[SIZE][SIZE] = 
 { { 1, 8 }, { 2, 4, 6 }, { 5 } };
 for(size_t x = 0; x < SIZE; ++x){
    for(size_t y = 0; y < SIZE; ++y){
        printf("%d", table[x][y]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
6.5 Find the error in each of the following program segments and correct the error.
a) #define SIZE 100;
ans: semicolon should be omitted
b) SIZE = 10;
ans: SIZE cannot be redefined because it is a predefined symbolic constant
c) Assume int b[10] = { 0 }, i;
 for (i = 0; i <= 10; ++i) {
 b[i] = 1;
 }
 ans: cannot access variable at b[10] because it is out of bounds
d) #include <stdio.h>;
ans: no semicolon should be there after the file has been included
e) Assume int a[2][2] = { { 1, 2 }, { 3, 4 } };
 a[1, 1] = 5;
 ans: the assignment operation will no work becuase of the invalid syntax 
      when the variable is being referenced
f) #define VALUE = 120
ans: There shouldn't be an assignment operator

Fill in the blanks in each of the following:
a) Arrays are ______ entities as they remain the same size during program execution.
ans: static
b) An array is a ______ group of memory locations that share the same ______.
ans: contiguous, data type
c) The first element in every array is the ______ element, for example, the first element of
an array is referred to as ______.
ans: 0th element, element 0
d) Array elements are referred by ______ followed by the ______ of the element.
ans: array name, index of the element
e) Arrays are passed to functions by ______.
ans: value
f) C has no array ______, which means a program can accidentally store data passing the
bound of the array.
ans: bounds checking
g) The ______ operator cannot be used directly with arrays for copying data from one array to another.
ans: assignment
h) Every string contains a special string-termination character called the ______ character,
represented by the character constant ______.

6.7 State which of the following are true and which are false. If false, explain why.
a) If there are fewer initializers in an initializer list than the number of elements in the array,
the remaining elements will contain garbage values.
ans: false, they would be initialized to zero
b) A static local variable in a function definition exists for the duration of the program.
ans: true, it's restricted by the function scope

c) The type size_t represents an unsigned integral type 
ans: true
d) If the array size is omitted from a definition with an initializer list, the number of elements 
in the array will not be defined.
ans: false, the compiler determines the size of the array based on the number of elements in it

e) To calculate the amount of memory used by an array, multiply the number of elements
by the size in bytes each element occupies.
ans: true
f) When individual array elements are passed to a function, they are passed by reference
and their modified value is retained in the calling function.
ans: false, array elements are passed by value
6.8 Write statements to accomplish each of the following:
a) Multiply the value of element 4 of an integer array n with 3 and display it.

b) Write a loop that adds all the elements of the array n[10] and stores the result in total.
code: int total = 0;
for (size_t i = 0; i < 10; ++i){
    total += n[i];
}
c) Initialize each of the 9 elements of a two-dimensional integer array m[3][3] to 3, using
loops. 
for (size_t i = 0; i < 3); ++i{
    for(size_t j = 0; j < 3; ++j){
        n[i][j] = 3;
    }
}
