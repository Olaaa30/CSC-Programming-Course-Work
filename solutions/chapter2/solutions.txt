2.1. Fill in the blanks in each of the following.
a) Every C program begins execution at the function _______
ans: Programs in C begin execution at the function 'Main'

b) Every function’s body begins with and ends with____
ans: Functions' bodies begin with a left brace and end with 'right braces'

c) Every statement ends with a(n) .
ans: Statements in C end with semicolons

d) The standard library function displays information on the screen.
ans: Printf is a standard library function that outputs info on the screen

e) The escape sequence \n represents the "NEWLINE" character, which causes the cursor
to position to the beginning of the next line on the screen.

f) The "SCANF" Standard Library function is used to obtain data from the keyboard.

g) The conversion specifier "%d" is used in a scanf format control string to indicate
that an integer will be input and in a printf format control string to indicate that an
integer will be output.

h) Whenever a new value is placed in a memory location, that value overrides the previous
value in that location. This process is said to be DESTRUCTIVE

i) When a value is read from a memory location, the value in that location is preserved;
this process is said to be NONDESTRUCTIVE 

j) The IF CONDITIONAL statement is used to make decisions.

2.2 State whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.

a) Function printf always begins printing at the beginning of a new line.
ans: False.  Function printf always begins printing where the cursor is positioned,
and this may be anywhere on a line of the screen.The printf function doesn't include the newline character by default(a charactertic of 'puts')

b) Comments cause the computer to display the text after // on the screen when the program is executed.
ans: False. comments don not cause any action to be performed when the program is executed

c) The escape sequence \n when used in a printf format control string causes the cursor
to position to the beginning of the next line on the screen.
ans: True

d) All variables must be defined before they’re used.
ans: True

e) All variables must be given a type when they’re defined. 
ans: True

f) C considers the variables number and NuMbEr to be identical.
ans: False. C is case sensitive.

g) Definitions can appear anywhere in the body of a function.
ans: True

h) All arguments following the format control string in a printf function must be preceded by an ampersand (&).
ans: False. This rule only applies to arguments when using "scanf"

i) The remainder operator (%) can be used only with integer operands.
ans: True

j) The arithmetic operators *, /, %, + and - all have the same level of precedence.
ans: False. operators have different levels of precedence.

k) A program that prints three lines of output must contain three printf statements.
ans: False. The escape sequence \n can use to print new lines.

2.3 Write a single C statement to accomplish each of the following:
a) Define the variables c, thisVariable, q76354 and number to be of type int.
ans: int c, thisVariable, q76354, number;

b) Prompt the user to enter an integer. End your prompting message with a colon (:) followed by a 
   space and leave the cursor positioned after the space.
ans: printf("Enter an integer: ");

c) Read an integer from the keyboard and store the value entered in integer variable a.
ans: scanf("%d", &a);

d) If number is not equal to 7, print "The variable number is not equal to 7."
ans: if (number != 7){
    puts("The variable number is not equal to 7.");
};

e) Print the message "This is a C program." on one line.
ans: puts("This is a C program.");

f) Print the message "This is a C program." on two lines so that the first line ends with C. 
ans: printf("This is a C \n program.\n");

g) Print the message "This is a C program." with each word on a separate line.
ans: printf("This \n is \n a \n C \n program.");

h) Print the message "This is a C program." with the words separated by tabs.
ans: printf("This \t is \t a \t C \t program. ");

2.4 Write a statement (or comment) to accomplish each of the following:
a) State that a program will calculate the product of three integers.
ans: //Program which calculates the product of three integers

b) Prompt the user to enter three integers.
ans: printf("Enter three integers: ");

c) Define the variables x, y and z to be of type int.
ans: int x, y, z;

d) Read three integers from the keyboard and store them in the variables x, y and z.
ans: scanf("%d %d %d", &x, &y, &z);

e) Define the variable result, compute the product of the integers in the variables x, y and
z, and use that product to initialize the variable result.
ans: int result = x * y * z;

f) Print "The product is" followed by the value of the integer variable result.
ans: printf("The product is %d", result);

2.5 Using the statements you wrote in Exercise 2.4, write a complete program that calculates
the product of three integers.
ans: int main (void){
    //prompt user for integers
    printf("Enter three integers: ");
    
    //initialize variables
    int x, y, z;

    //read and store ints entered by user
    scanf("%d %d %d", &x, &y, &z);

    //compute the result and store in variable
    int result = x * y * z;

    //print result
    printf("The product is %d", result);
}
2.6 Identify and correct the errors in each of the following statements:
a) printf( "The value is %d\n", &number );
ans: There should not be an ampersand before the variable 'number'

b) scanf( "%d%d", &number1, number2 );
ans: There should be an ampersand before the variable 'number2'

c) if ( c < 7 );{
 printf( "C is less than 7\n" );
} 
ans: There shouldn't be a semicolon after the conditional statement

d) if ( c => 7 ) {
 printf( "C is greater than or equal to 7\n" );
} 
ans: The operator should be written as '>=' instead of '=>'
