A struct that contains a member that is a pointer to
the same structure type is a SELF REFERENTIAL STRUCTURE
A structure cannot contain an instance of itself.
#Structure definitions do not reserve any space in memory;
Each defintion creates a new data type which is kinda like a 
blueprint of how to build instances of that struct.

SO STRUCTURES ARE BASICALLY YOU CREATING YOUR OWN DATA TYPES

*The structure tag name could also be omitted but then I'd have to declare all variables of that 
struct type in the struct definition.

VALID OPERATIONS THAT MAY BE PERFORMED ON STRUCTURES
- Assigning struct variables to struct variables of the same type - for a pointer
  member, this copies only the address stored in the pointer
- Taking the address of a struct variable
- Accessing the members of a struct variable
- using the sizeof operator to determine the size of a struct variables

Boundaries:
- Half-word
- word
- double-word 
A word is a memory unit used to store data in a computer. Usually 4 bytes or 8 bytes.
Representation of a structure is machine dependent.
